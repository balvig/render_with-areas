# RenderWithAreas

Makes it easy to name and render multiple content areas in a partial,
instead of being limited to just the one `yield`.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the Rails application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
$ bundle add render_with_areas
```

Include it in `ApplicationHelper` in your Rails app:

```rb
module ApplicationHelper
  include RenderWithAreas
end
```

## Usage

Example:

```erb
<!-- app/views/ui/_modal.html.erb -->

<div class="modal">
  <header class="modal__header">
    <%= header %>
  </header>

  <main>
    <%= content %>
  </main>

  <footer class="modal__footer">
    <%= footer %>
  </footer>
</div>

<!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->

<%= render_with_areas do |layout| %>
  <% layout.with :header do %>
    <h1>Modal Title</h1>
  <% end %>

  This will show up as "content"

  <% layout.with :footer do %>
    This will show up in the modal footer.
  <% end %>
<% end %>


<!-- also supports locals, strings -->
<%= render_with_areas, title: "Modal Title" do |layout| %>
  This will show up as "content"

  <% layout.with :footer, "Footer" %>
<% end %>
```
